The purpose of the files in this directory is to redirect references from
starburst-galaxy/sql/ref to the equivalent locations in the new structure,
starburst-galaxy/reference/sql/ref.

There is no attempt to redirect every page in the Galaxy SQL reference, but only
the top-level pages that are linked from the SQL overview page on
starburst-galaxy/reference/sql/index.html.

This directory will eventually be unnecessary as saved cross-refs and hard-coded
links in the Galaxy UI are migrated to the new locations.
