### Test the connection

Once you have configured the connection details, use the **Test connection**
button to confirm data access is working. If the test is successful, you can
then save the catalog.

If the test fails, {{site.terms.sg}} provides detailed diagnostic information
that you can use to fix the database configuration in the cloud provider system.
