#### Hive Metastore Service

You can use a Hive Metastore Service (HMS) to manage the metadata about your
object storage. The HMS must be located in the same cloud provider and region as
the object storage itself.

Configure access with the following parameters:

* **Hive Metastore host**, the fully qualified domain name of the HMS server.
* **Hive Metastore port**, the port used by the HMS, typically 9083.
