A connection to the database can be established directly, if the
{{site.terms.sg}} IP range/CIDR is allowed to connect.

If the database is only accessible inside the virtual private cloud (VPC) of
the cloud provider, you can [use an SSH tunnel](../security/ssh-tunnels.html)
with a bastion host in the VPC.
