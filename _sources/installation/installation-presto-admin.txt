Presto Admin is a tool for installing and managing the Presto query engine on a
cluster. It provides easy-to-use commands to:

    * Install and uninstall Presto across your cluster
    * Configure your Presto cluster
    * Start and stop the Presto servers
    * Gather status and log information from your Presto cluster


Use Presto Admin and the following procedures to install Presto on one or more nodes.
This is an alternative to the installation steps described at
`prestodb.io <https://prestodb.io/docs/current/installation.html>`_. Using the
Presto Admin tool is the simplest and preferred method for installing and managing
a Presto cluster.

For a detailed explanation of all of the commands and their options, see:
