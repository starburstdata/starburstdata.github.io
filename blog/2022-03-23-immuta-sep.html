    <p>This blog was co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meetsumit/">Sumit
Sarkar</a>, Sr. Director, Product Marketing
at Immuta.</p>

<p>In today’s global economy, it’s impossible to understate the importance of being
able to access data efficiently and securely, regardless of where it resides. As
external data sharing becomes increasingly common, data use agreements and
regulatory requirements, including <a href="https://www.immuta.com/articles/data-localization/">data
localization</a> laws, make it
difficult for data platform teams to keep up and manage a compliant system.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Starburst and Immuta minimize complexity so the right people are able to access
the right data at the right time, no matter where the data lives. As a federated
query engine, <a href="https://www.starburst.io/platform/starburst-enterprise/">Starburst
Enterprise</a> acts as a
single access point across even the most complex data architectures. Immuta, the
leader in automated <a href="https://www.immuta.com/capabilities/data-access-control/">data access
control</a>, centralizes
data access policy management and enforcement so that policies are dynamically
and consistently applied at query time.  The latest release of Starburst
Enterprise ships with Immuta, making it easier than ever to provide <a href="https://blog.starburst.io/rapid-controlled-access-to-data-with-starburst-and-immuta">rapid,
controlled access to
data</a>
across data mesh architectures.</p>

<h2 id="starburst-adds-support-for-data-access-control-with-immuta">Starburst adds support for data access control with Immuta</h2>

<p>Starburst is the analytics engine built for <a href="https://www.immuta.com/articles/what-is-a-data-mesh/">data
mesh</a>, allowing
organizations to use data from multiple data warehouses, which in turn enables
domain-driven data ownership and architecture. This core data mesh principle
reduces pipeline complexity and makes data infrastructure more flexible and
agile. However, the decentralized nature of data mesh architectures can make
consistent data access control and policy enforcement difficult to manage at
scale.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.immuta.com/articles/sql-is-your-data-mesh-api/">SQL is your data mesh API</a></p>

<p>To proactively solve this issue and avoid unauthorized data access, Starburst
has added simplified, built-in support for Immuta
<a href="https://www.immuta.com/data-governance-deployment/">SaaS</a> and
<a href="https://www.immuta.com/self-managed-deployment/">self-managed</a> deployment
methods. Starburst users can now seamlessly get up and running with automated
data access control across their data mesh, with minimal overhead or maintenance
required. As a result, users across any domain can query data from any platform
through Starburst Enterprise, and Immuta acts as an invisible layer that
enforces data access policies at runtime.</p>

<p>Immuta and Starburst Enterprise separate policy and data platform. As a result
users can access data more quickly, while enforcing business and regulatory
policies with the most comprehensive and easy-to-use access controls in place.
This allows data teams to maximize the power and flexibility of data mesh
without losing time or data security.</p>

<p>How is this done? When plugged into Starburst Enterprise, Immuta enables users with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.immuta.com/capabilities/sensitive-data-discovery/">Sensitive data discovery and
classification</a></strong>,
which includes more than 60 prebuilt classifiers, as well as the ability to
build custom tags. Tags can also map to specific data privacy laws and be
implemented through global starter policies. This streamlines certification
workflows by making it easy for stakeholders across functions to inspect and
approve tags.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scalable <a href="https://www.immuta.com/capabilities/attribute-based-access-control/">attribute-based access control
(ABAC)</a></strong>,
which leverages metadata and user/subject attributes to make context-based
access decisions at query time. Data teams can author policies in plain English
so stakeholders have visibility into how data is being protected without
requiring SQL expertise or additional data engineering resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Advanced policy building and <a href="https://www.immuta.com/capabilities/dynamic-data-masking/">dynamic data
masking</a></strong> through
techniques like privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), including differential
privacy, conditional masking, and k-anonymization, as well as the ability to
easily limit data use for specific purposes to ensure secure data
collaboration. Immuta allows users to implement both global and local
policies, so that data owners and data platform owners can control access to
data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.immuta.com/capabilities/data-policy-enforcement/">Data policy enforcement and
auditing</a></strong>, which
automates access control implementation at query time with no impact to user
workflows, and provides unified data access logs that show how data is
requested, accessed, and used. Immuta also allows organizations using service
accounts from BI dashboards to impersonate end users in order to restrict
access with no impact to the user or risk of a data leak.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these capabilities allow Starburst Enterprise users to scale policy
management through automation, increase agility across teams by empowering more
stakeholders to manage policy, and easily prove compliant data use at any time.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at how to get up and running with Starburst Enterprise
and Immuta.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-immuta-access-control-with-starburst-enterprise">Implementing Immuta access control with Starburst Enterprise</h2>

<p>The <a href="../latest/security/biac-overview.html">built-in access control of Starburst
Enterprise</a> is role-based and provides a
baseline for data security and privacy management. For organizations scaling
data use or leveraging sensitive data, particularly for data sharing, Immuta
adds a robust layer of advanced protection and control.</p>

<p>To get started, Starburst Enterprise users need an active Immuta account and API
key. Immuta manages access control for existing users and groups, regardless of
the type of user authentication used with Starburst Enterprise.</p>

<p>Once Starburst Enterprise is registered as a data source in Immuta, you’re able
to perform the following tasks</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configure catalogs for your cluster’s data sources with no process changes.</li>
  <li>Configure a catalog for an Immuta connector.</li>
  <li>Create an entry for each schema that is managed by Immuta. Immuta creates a
view to represent the schema in its domain.</li>
  <li>Configure an Immuta event listener in Starburst Enterprise.</li>
  <li>Configure file-based access control in Starburst Enterprise.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps ensure that queries are validated by Immuta’s dynamic access
control, then passed back to Starburst Enterprise for analysis and query
processing. Let’s take a closer look at how it works in practice.</p>

<h2 id="query-changes">Query changes</h2>

<p>When adding schemas to Immuta, it’s important to differentiate between the
Immuta schema names and the underlying Starburst Enterprise schema names.
Similarly, tables that exist in multiple Starburst Enterprise catalogs should
each have a unique name to make it easy to distinguish which are under Immuta’s
control.</p>

<p>Integrating Immuta with Starburst Enterprise allows you to run the same  SQL
queries you run directly with Starburst Enterprise. However, you must use the
catalog name immuta and the schema names recognized by Immuta to ensure the
Immuta policies are taken into account. For instance, you can use the <a href="../latest/client/query-editor.html">Starburst
Enterprise query editor</a> to browse the
immuta catalog and identify specific schemas and tables, with no change to the
catalog.schema.table hierarchy. An example query for a table labeled customers
might look like this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">myimmuta</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">orcl_accounting</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">customers</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admin users are able to see the underlying schema names and reach the same table with the following query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">oracle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">accounting</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">customers</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="configuring-an-immuta-catalog">Configuring an Immuta catalog</h2>

<p>Immuta now ships with Starburst Enterprise. To configure the Immuta connector
and activate the plugin, you must create a configuration file in your cluster’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">etc/catalog</code> folder. This catalog properties file name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myimmuta.properties</code>
determines the name of the catalog to use for querying data via Immuta. In the
preceding example query the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myimmuta</code> is used. The file needs to specify
usage of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">immuta</code> connector with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connector-name</code> property and include the
URL of your Immuta server and the API key:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>connector-name=immuta
immuta-endpoint=your-Immuta-site's-URL
immuta-apikey=your-API-key
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>connector-name=immuta
immuta-endpoint=https://www.immuta.example.com/
immuta-apikey=e16456a3395d42988c2da6f06ccf1f58
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="configuring-an-immuta-event-listener">Configuring an Immuta event listener</h2>

<p>Immuta audit event listeners enable you to audit queries on your Starburst
Enterprise cluster so you can see what data is used and prove compliance with
internal and external rules and regulations. Event listeners must be configured
in a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">event-listener.properties</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">etc</code> folder and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">immuta-catalogs</code> value must match the name of the catalog.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>event.listener.name=immuta-event-listener
immuta-endpoint=https://www.immuta.example.com/
immuta-apikey=e16456a3395d42988c2da6f06ccf1f58
immuta.catalogs=myimmuta
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="managing-system-access-control">Managing system access control</h2>

<p>There are two processes that fall outside of Immuta’s control, and are
controlled in Starburst Enterprise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prevent direct access to catalogs for standard users trying to bypass Immuta.</li>
  <li>Protecting Immuta-managed tables from inadvertent secrets disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can control these with the file-based access control and a JSON rules file
in Starburst Enterprise:</p>

<p>The first step here is adding a configuration file called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">access-control.properties</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">etc</code> folder with the following two lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>access-control.name=file
security.config-file=etc/access-rules.json
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Below shows a starting point for an access-rules.json file:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"catalogs"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">

<p>This rules file grants anyone with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">super_admin</code> role full access to both
Immuta-managed and non-Immuta-managed catalogs. It also ensures <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IT</code> has full
access to Immuta-managed objects but no other catalogs, and it gives read-only
access to Immuta-managed schemas and tables to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query_user</code> roles. This
configuration prevents users from running
<a href="../latest/sql/describe.html">DESCRIBE</a> on Immuta views and avoids secret
disclosures in masking policies. Finally, the rules file ensures that non-Immuta
catalog access defaults to none for everyone except <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">super_admin</code>.</p>

<p>With Immuta integrated with Starburst Enterprise, you’re able to seamlessly
create data access policies once and enforce them across all data, so the right
people are able to access the right data at the right time.</p>
